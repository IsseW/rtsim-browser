VELOREN_CANARY_MAGIC

If you're seeing this text, congratulations! One of two things is true:

1) You've got a normal, pre-compiled build of the game and the asset
   directory is present and populated.

2) You've cloned the repository locally and git LFS has
    been properly set up, meaning that the asset directory should be
    fully populated.

If you don't see this text and instead you just see a file hash... well,
there's no point me saying anything in such a scenario.
