    Welcome to the alpha version of Veloren!

    Before you dive into the fun, please keep a few things in mind:

    - This is a very early alpha. Expect bugs, extremely unfinished gameplay, unpolished mechanics, and missing features.

    - If you have constructive feedback or bug reports, you can contact us on our GitLab repository and on our Discord or Matrix server.

    - Veloren is open source. You are free to play, modify, and redistribute the game in accordance to version 3 of the GNU General Public license.

    - Veloren is a non-profit community project, and everybody working on it is a volunteer.
    If you like what you see, you are welcome to join any of our working groups!

    Thanks for taking the time to read this notice, we hope you enjoy the game!
