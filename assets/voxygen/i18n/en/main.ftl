    Welcome to the alpha version of Veloren!
    
    Before you dive into the fun, please keep a few things in mind:
    
    - This is a very early alpha. Expect bugs, extremely unfinished gameplay, unpolished mechanics, and missing features.
    
    - If you have constructive feedback or bug reports, you can contact us via Reddit, GitLab, or our community Discord server.
    
    - Veloren is licensed under the GPL 3 open-source licence. That means you're free to play, modify, and redistribute the game however
     you wish (provided derived work is also under GPL 3).
    
    - Veloren is a non-profit community project, and everybody working on it is a volunteer.
    If you like what you see, you're welcome to join the development or art teams!
    
    Thanks for taking the time to read this notice, we hope you enjoy the game!
